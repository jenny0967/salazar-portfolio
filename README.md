#Salazar-portfolio
Creating my personal website gave me an opportunity to showcase not just my skills and projects but also who I am as a person. I wanted the website to reflect my personality, my passions, and my professional journey in a way that feels authentic and approachable.

Through the design and content, I aimed to highlight my strengths, whether it’s my technical abilities in web development, my creativity in design, or my commitment to continuous learning. The website serves as a digital portfolio where visitors can get a sense of what I value and what motivates me. For example, including sections about my hobbies and interests helps humanize my online presence and allows people to connect with me beyond just my work.

Building this site also pushed me to think deeply about how I want to present myself to the world. What kind of impression do I want to leave? What stories do I want to tell? This reflection helped me clarify my goals and the kind of career path I want to pursue.

Overall, my website is more than just a collection of pages; it’s a personal statement. It represents my journey so far, my aspirations for the future, and my desire to grow both professionally and personally. I’m proud of the way it encapsulates who I am and excited to keep updating it as I evolve.
